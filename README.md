# Sound Alerts Expanded

Sound Alerts Expanded is an installable plugin for Old School RuneScape (OSRS), available via the Plugin Hub on the [RuneLite](https://runelite.net) game client.

## What is Sound Alerts Expanded?
This plugin introduces a broader range of sound triggers throughout the game.

## Current Features
### Triggers
- Receive an audio alert when near a herb patch without the Farming Cape or Max Cape equipped (dependent on whether you have 99 Farming).


## Customization
### Replacing Audio Files
To replace an audio file:
1. Navigate to the `sound-alerts-expanded` folder in your `.runelite` directory.
2. Replace the desired `.wav` file with your own sound clip.

The default voice is a demonstration generated via a voice generator. You are encouraged to use your own custom sounds.
