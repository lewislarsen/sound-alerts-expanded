# Sound Alerts Expanded

## What is it?
This plugin aims to expand upon the popular C-Engineer Announcer plugin by adding a variety of different sound triggers throughout the game.

## Got an idea?
Make an issue and I'll consider adding it.

## Found an issue?
Please open a new issue on the repository and I'll take a look. I'm a web developer by trade so this is new territory for me. :) 

## Inspiration
Thank you to the C-Engineer Announcer plugin for giving me inspiration to work on this project. The plugin heavily uses portions of the code from the C-Engineer plugin, and it wouldn't have been possible without it.
